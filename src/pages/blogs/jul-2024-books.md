**Hello again, welcome to my Monthly Reads: July Edition.** Last month, I enjoyed two feel-good novels from my favorite authors.
<br/><br/>

I'll also share my experience traveling to Tokyo, Japan, and some inspiring conversations I had with my managers, colleagues, and friends.
<br/><br/>

**Let’s dive into the two beautiful novels I read:**

### Comfort & Joy - Kristan Hannah

This cozy story follows a recent divorcée caught in an emotional dilemma involving her sister. She ends up in a plane crash that leaves her in a coma. Through Kristan Hannah's brilliant storytelling, we’re transported into the victim's dreamy narration of what happens after the crash—she meets a boy and his father, who are grieving the recent loss of their mother. She falls in love with the father, only to realize later that it was all a dream while she was in a coma by the end of the first chapter. The rest of the book is about her awakening, bonding with her sister, and embracing the belief in magic. As they say, "Love is magic." This story felt like watching a well-played movie unfold.

### Anxious People - Fredrik Backman

A bank robbery that goes awry, leading to a hostage situation on New Year's Eve—what a plot! This funny, yet brilliant book by Fredrik Backman had me hooked. The storytelling is sharp, moving back and forth between witness interviews, the hostage situation, and the father-son police officer dynamics during the crisis. It allows readers to vividly picture the scenes as if a comedic movie is playing in their heads. I definitely recommend reading this book with a cup of coffee, relaxing after a hard day’s work.
<br/><br/>

I only had time to fully read these two books, though I’ve started on a third one, which I’ll cover in next month’s edition.
<br/><br/>

**Now, let me share my Tokyo travel experience, where I had some interesting and inspiring conversations.**

#### Conversation with my former manager, Thanh Binh Dao (Dao-san)

Dao-san is someone I always look up to for his unique management style and work ethic—I'm truly a fan of his approach. During our conversation, he emphasized the importance of continuous learning and deeply understanding the technology you're interested in. He believes that mastering technology isn't about memorizing syntax but grasping how things work. With AI (like Generative AI) becoming more efficient, understanding the underlying processes will empower you to ask the right questions and steer technology in your favor. He also highlighted the importance of hands-on experience. As Dao-san put it, knowing how something works allows you to confidently say, "I’ve done it," instead of merely "I’ve read about it."

#### Conversation with my former colleague, Jorge de Castro

Jorge, now an Engineering Manager, shared insights on balancing people and technology. He offered valuable tips on understanding team emotions and subtly guiding them toward your vision. He recounted experiences where he brought out the best in his team’s capabilities. Jorge also recommended a book, The Software Engineer’s Guidebook, which he found instrumental in his journey from Senior Engineer to Technical Lead, and now Engineering Manager. I’ll read the book and share a summary in an upcoming article.
<br/><br/>

**Being in Tokyo once again was a wonderful experience—learning about the business and culture, and gathering new ideas through conversations with our business stakeholders made it a productive trip.**
<br/><br/>

Lastly, but certainly not least, the people of Japan. Their hospitality and humility have won my heart once again. As I see it, **a developed nation shouldn’t be judged solely by its infrastructure, skyscrapers, and roads, but also by the maturity of its citizens**.
<br/><br/>

I’d like to conclude with a few photos of this amazing country. To Japan, “Arigatou gozaimasu!”
