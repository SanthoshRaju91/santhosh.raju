I'm an avid reader who finds solace in books, preferring them over movies or video games. Books create a comforting space just for me.

One day, it struck me: why not share my book reads through blogging? In a distracted and constantly connected world, inspiring others to find solace in reading is more valuable that ever.

So, here I am, embarking on my journey to write about the books I read each month, for as long as I can sustain it.

Last month, I read two books:

1. How to Finish Everythin You Start by Jan Yager
2. The Stolen Hours by Karen Swann

### How to Finish Everything You Start

This book by Jan Yager marks the first book I read through Kindle. Offering practical guide to overcoming procrastination and maintaining focus on tasks and projects, Yager provides actionable tips to:

1. Develop discipline
2. Manage time effectively
3. Sustain motivation throughout the journey of achieveing your goals.

The book begins by exploring the reasons behind unfinished tasks in Part 1, then offers solutions in Part 2.

One technique I found particulary effective in the "Cures" section is F.I.N.I.S.H

- F = Focus on one priority task
- I = Ignore interruptions or distractions
- N = Now is the time, not later or tomorrow
- I = Initiate and innovate to keep momentum
- S = Stay the course, no matter the challenges
- H = Hail finishing by celebrating accomplishments

Saying "No" has always been a challenge for me, whether at work, in volunteering, or in personal life. Yager provides subtle ways to politely decline tasks that don't align with your interests or when you're already overloaded.

In conclusion, while procrastination isn't a significant issue in my life, this book lives up to its title, Highly recommended for those struggling with procrastination, but remember to diligently apply the techniques and return to them if you slip up.

### The Stolen Hours

This second installment of "The Wild Isle" series by Karen Swann focuses on Mhairi. Swann intricately weaves Mhairi's story into the plot, keeping readers engaged. However, the mystery of what truly happened on the night of evacuation remains unsolved.

The characterization of Donald and his unwavering love for Mhairi raises readers' curiosity about their fate and the resolution of their love story.

It would have been helpful if the author had provided character references either at the beginning or end of the book, as I struggled to recall characters from the previous book, "Last Summer."

While the story does end with conventional happy ending, it seems to set the stage for the third book, leaving readers with the thought that "a patch was always better than a hole."
