**Hello once again, welcome back to my Monthly Reads: October Edition**

The past month was bit hectic, with product demos and multiple releases. Despite the busy schedule, I managed to read two good books. With this, I'm just 4 books away from completing my Goodreads reading challenge of reading 22 books this year. Checkout my [Goodreads challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11634-2024-reading-challenge) to see all the books I've read so far.

### The Women by Kristan Hannah

> War leaves a permanent scar on humanity, regardless of whether you're a man or a woman

Kristin Hannah shines once again in her latest book, highlighting the societal oppression and ignorance towards women in war.
<br/><br/>

The novel tells the story of a woman who volunteers to join the Vietnam War as an Army nurse following the death of her brother in the same war. She serves her country amidst the gruesome horrors of one of the most hated wars in American history, only to return home and find her service met with shame and dismissal by her family and society at large. The book brilliantly captures her journey through love, lies, friendship, hatred, alcoholism, drug abuse, and eventual rehabilitation as she fights to rediscover her purpose in life.
<br/><br/>

While reading, I reflected on how our lives are often dictated by societal expectations rather than our own decisions / desires. As the author puts it:

**"Most of us have made too many decisions based on other people. We need to do what we truly need to do."**
<br/><br/>

The suffering, trauma, and nightmares of war are universal, regardless of gender. While physical abilities may differ, the emotional and psychological toll is the same. Wars are humanity's curse—oppressive, disheartening, and yet inevitable because human desires are limitless.
<br/><br/>

I can’t fathom the pain of people enduring the ongoing wars around the world. Sadly, the suffering of innocents rarely captures the headlines, overshadowed by celebrity scandals, political corruption, or gruesome crimes. Our attention is engineered toward these sensational stories in the form of shorts / reels / headlines, leaving the true victims of war overlooked.
<br/><br/>

My thoughts and prayers go out to innocent people and families caught in wars they had no hand in starting.

### South of the border, West of the sun by Haruki Murakami

After reading Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki, I quickly realized Haruki Murakami is a favorite among my professional circle. Just as I was about to pick up Norwegian Wood, my manager and close friend recommended this book. Conveniently, we were in a bookstore, and I immediately added it to my cart. That’s how I ended up reading this beautiful novel.
<br/><br/>

The story follows a man torn between his love for his wife and children and his attraction to a childhood friend whose backstory remains mysterious throughout the book. This mystery woman reappears in his life, reigniting feelings that cause him to spiral into foolish decisions, even considering abandoning his family. Before this can happen, the mystery woman vanishes once again without a trace.
<br/><br/>

I loved the setting, particularly the protagonist’s rise to success running two popular jazz bars in Tokyo. Just when life seems perfect, the mystery woman re-enters his world, flipping everything upside down.
<br/><br/>

It’s a powerful story of how human desires remain in constant flux. No matter how accomplished or content we may seem, there’s always a longing for something else—**Unsettling, and yet we all think we have settled. What an irony!!!**
<br/><br/>

As my second Murakami novel, I’m growing fond of his open-ended conclusions that leave room for the reader’s imagination. Once again, he masterfully hands over the reins, allowing us to interpret the story’s conclusion.

### Conclusion

Both books offered profound insights—one delving into the societal struggles of women in war, and the other exploring the complexities of love, desire, and human imperfection.
