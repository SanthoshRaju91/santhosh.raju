Wrapping up a busy March with Khaled Hosseini's gripping tales, it's been quite a tough month, especially here in Bengaluru with water shortages and scorching heat waves. I managed to read just two books due to my hectic schedule, but I'm determined not to let it derail my goal of reading 22 books this year.

<br/>

In April, I'm planning to kick off a new routine of reading one book per week. No matter the outcome, I'll keep you all posted on how it goes in a couple of months.

<br/>

Here's a quick summary of the two books I read in March:

### And the Mountains Echoed

The tale begins with a brother and sister torn part at a tender age, the girl raised by a wealthy family who shield her from the knowledge of her true family. As the narration of the book unfolds against the backdrop of **War**, each character's story intricately weaves together, ultimately leading to the reunion of the siblings.

<br/>

Hosseini's masterful storytelling shines in this novel, as he navigates through the lives of diverse characters, seamlessly intertwining their journeys to reunite the siblings. Despite the book's length, I found myself captivated by the author's ability to seamlessly merge each character's narrative into the plot.

<br/>

This book serves as a deeply and emotionally touching conclusion to Hosseini's compelling stories, and I extend my heartfelt gratitude to him for crafting such wonderful stories.

### How to Become a Straight-A Student

Let me answer the inevitable questions that has arised, before I provide my summary of the book.

1. Isn't it already too late for you ?
2. What do you hope to achieve from this book ?

Yes, I know it might seem late, but I believe it's better late than never and definitely not too late for self-improvement.

<br/>

During my college years, I was an above average student who was passionate about a handful of subjects. Yet I was consistently falling short of achieving top marks. However, toppers of my class where able to secure top marks without much hassle. This discrepancy between my efforts and the achievements of my peers left me puzzled.

<br/>

"How to Become a Straight-A Student" offers invaluable insights into the study techniques employed by high-achieving students, shedding light on the strategies applicable not only in the United States but globally as well.

<br/>

As for the second question, I am intent on resuming my studies and pursuing a master's degree. The methods and strategies outlined in the book would undoubtedly help me to enhance my study habits and facilitate more effective learning.

### Conclusion

March may have been quite a ride for everyone, but it's left me content with literary treasures and newfound aspirations. As always, I thank all my readers for taking their time to visit my blog. Until next month, take care and thank you for your support.
