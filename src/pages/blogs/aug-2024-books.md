**Hello again, welcome back to my Monthly Reads: August Edition!**

For this edition, I’ll be talking about the two books I read. The first was a beautiful novel, and the second was a productive self-help book. Without further ado, let me begin.
<br/>

### Midnight Library by Matt Haig

Between life and death, there is a library. As the protagonist of the story decides to end her life, she discovers this mystical library that changes her whole perspective on life. In the library, she learns that there are alternate lives in addition to her root life. She has the magical power to visit these alternate lives.
<br/><br/>
This is where the author's brilliant storytelling and ability to condense the whole concept of the multiverse into a compelling narrative shine. As the protagonist visits each of these alternate lives, hoping to realize what real happiness in life would be, she becomes increasingly disillusioned in each life.
<br/><br/>
As I read, I came to realize that alternate lives are nothing more than diversions in the journey of life. While reading the book, I found myself wondering what my life would have been like if I had chosen a different career, a different profession, or had a more supportive father or siblings. However, as the book concludes, the author teaches us a valuable lesson about life, which is simply "Just to live." We are always branding our lives or saying we have a purpose to fulfill. In my opinion, you just have to live, because that is the only purpose of life. For an ant or worm, there is no grand purpose. They just live and make every possible effort to survive.
<br/><br/>
Overall, it’s a wonderful book that makes you reflect, filled with nostalgic feelings and daydreams. You just need to pull yourself back and keep reading.

### Smarter, Faster, Better by Charles Duhigg

This book reveals the secrets of being productive, and the author has done extensive research on the subject. It is a well-researched and condensed book, to say the least. The book focuses on key topics like:

1. Motivation
2. Goal setting
3. Focus
4. Decision-making
5. Innovation

I found the chapters on Goal Setting and Focus particularly interesting, as I was already familiar with and have been using the S.M.A.R.T. goal approach. The author’s addition of the concept of "stretch goals" gave me a fresh perspective on solidifying my goal-setting approach. In a world full of constant distractions, both digital and at the workplace, his strategic approach to staying focused was a much-needed chapter.
<br/><br/>
I liked how the author connected each topic to real-life incidents, helping the reader understand the reasons behind and approaches to each subject. It wouldn’t be fair for me to give one-liners for such extensively researched topics in just one blog post. Hopefully, I will write about some of the approaches I’ve learned in upcoming blogs, serving the practical side of the topics.

### Conclusion

Both books offered unique perspectives - one on the philosophy of life and the other on practical productivity. While **Midnight Library** made me reflect on life's purpose and the choices we make, **Smarter, Faster, Better** equipped me with tools to set better goals, how to find motivation, stay focused, using strategies while making decisions and how to innovate.
<br/><br/>
BTW, with these 2 books I finished reading a total of 15 books. Only 7 more books to be read for completing the 2024 [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/51215057) reading challenge.
<br/><br/>
Thank for reading, until next time take care.
